Simulator for the GreenArrays GA144

Status
------

Just starting out ...

Raison d'Ãªtre 
-------------

GreenArrays' GA144 is a wonderfully idiosyncratic microprocessor:

- fully asynchronous logic
- 32 orthogonal instructions
- 64 words of RAM and ROM
- 18 bit 'word'
- 144 on-chip cores in a rectangular array

all of which conspire to make a software simulation relatively straightforward. And fun :-). 
 
Notes
-----

The ColorForth IDE is something only a mother could love (she *would* have to be an exceptionally kind,
forgiving and loving mother). And the official manual for the IDE is ummm, cryptic in the extreme (?). 
There are several fairly helpful tutorials out there, of which the [HCC!Forth][hccforth] seemed to be the
one that gets you up and running with the least loss of hair. Just in case it ever goes missing, there is
a copy of the webpage in the archive folder (hopefully nobody at HCC!Forth minds too much).
