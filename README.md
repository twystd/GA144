Notes
-----

The ColorForth IDE is something only a mother could love (although she *would* have to be an incredibly
gentle, forgiving and loving mother). The official documentation for the IDE on the other hand is ummm,
cryptic in the extreme ? Of all the tutorials out there, the [HCC!Forth][hccforth] is the one that gets
you up and running with the least loss of hair. Just in case it ever goes missing, there is a copy of 
the webpage in the archive folder - hopefully nobody minds too much.
